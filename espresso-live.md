Espresso Live - v. 16.08 - www.ars-rpg.com
The fast line. Only the three Attitudes for fast sessions and board games. 


The live role-playing game is a great theatrical improvisation in which all the players are actors engaged in interpreting their own character.
There is no definite narration or setting: on an initial scene, prepared by a "Magister" (who organizes the event and certifies its safety), your character is free to interact as he believes with the other characters and with the story that you share. The aim of the game is to have fun and better interpret your character by living a real adventure together.
*ARS Espresso * is an ultra-light regulation that wants to bring the role play to the simplicity and speed of the board game. This manual presents basic mechanics ready for the game and which, depending on the settings, can be expanded at will.



1. The character
Each player prepares a  *card of the character by * dividing  *10 creation points * into three values ​​called Attitudes and corresponding to all the types of tests that will meet:

 
CORPUS
Physical strength, endurance and melee attack

CELERITAS
Speed, precision, instrument use and distance attack

ANIMUS
Knowledge, communication, perception and magical arts


[NOTE]  Note: To create more or less advanced characters, the Magister can grant a number of Creation Points higher or lower: 5 Weak, 10 Normal, 15 Expert, 20 Heroic.

The player then notes the entries:  *Total Hit Points * (number of damages beyond which the character dies leaving the game) the value of Corpus x 2.  *Mana * (magic power reserve) total the value of Animus x 3. The Attitudes will remain unchanged for the whole life of the character but they will vary through the  *equipment that will never offer a bonus higher than the value that goes to increase *.

[EXAMPLE] Example: Luke creates the character of Ludvig imagining him as a valid investigator from the average physicist, decides to write down Corpus 3, Dexterity 2, Animus 5. As a result he scores 6 total hit points, 9 objects of maximum load, he can hit at a maximum distance of 4 meters and will have 15 total points-Mana.



2. The Game
In addition to the total freedom at stake, there are game conventions to be known and respected:
 *Start and end * : The game event begins with the Magister declaring the "Time in!" And ends with the Magister declaring the "Time out!". Between the beginning and the end there are no breaks in the interpretation and in any case the players will have to make sure that the game goes on.
 *Using Attitudes * : The character has to use his own Attitude to change the story or gain an advantage. To use Attitudes declares aloud: <em> *"ARS! [Attitude Name] [Value Used] " *</em> showing any cards or instruments used in the action.
The Attitude can be used in play towards the scenario (for example a game element that requires a minimum value of a certain Attitude to be used) in which (after the statement to be done aloud) just compare the minimum required value with that of the character. Otherwise the Attitude can be used in a  *competitive action * with another character (for example a fight). The competition will be won by the player with the highest declared value. In the case of combat the difference between the values ​​determines the hit points lost by the losing character.

[EXAMPLE] Ludvig and Ernest compete in a sword duel. Start a combat scene. Ludvig declares "ARS! Corpus 3! ", Ernest declares" ARS! Corpus 5! ". The scene will end with the defeat of Ludvig who will lose 2 hit points.

 *The "Hit Points" * : To indicate the health of the character, the count of "Hit Points" is used which decrease if the character suffers damage. At the end of his hit points the character dies and the player is forced to declare himself "out of play", leave the game objects on the ground and leave the field.
At the beginning of each hour all the characters take advantage of  *the recovery phase * that returns them: half of the total hit points and half of the total number of points-Mana.
 *The work in progress tape * (white and red) represents the limit between an area in play and an area out of play.  *A person's neck tape or on an object indicates an item that is not in play * and other players must ignore its presence.
 *The Master Card * is a card made recognizable by the symbol of the game printed in evidence and indicates a clue or a special game element. On the cover are reported any conditions to be met in order to read the contents of the sign. The signs are written in a clear way, so as to be understandable to anyone. If there are no different instructions, once the sign is read it must be torn and stored out of the way.

[EXAMPLE] A lock can carry the sign "Lock that requires 40 seconds of shouting to be cracked" and having completed when indicated the sign can be opened and read.

 *Master Cards * are cards that can be used to represent particular physical objects or game elements by reporting their relative bonuses.  *It is possible to carry a maximum number of cards / objects equal to the number of * the character's  *current Hit Points * , leaving any excess cards on the pitch. The Master Cards are to be shown when you use them and, if there are no different instructions,  *once used they must be torn and kept out of play * .

[EXAMPLE] Ludvig encounters a clue that needs a thorough investigation to be understood and is represented by a master card that includes a Animus value of 6 as a requirement. For this reason it shows the equipment card "Magnifying Glass" that rips, keeps in his pocket (out of play) and gives him a bonus of +2 allowing him to declare 7 of Animus to the test to understand the clue.

 *Theft and information * : Inside the game it is also possible to lie and steal. Keep in mind that  *there is no extra-game information * : when players exchange information regarding the game they are automatically considered in play and the information acquired can be used by their characters. As soon as possible  *the thief must deliver the stolen goods to the Magister * so that it can be traced and recovered by the rightful owner in the recovery phase.


3. Security Rules
 - Any kind of physical contact is forbidden. In particular attacks on the head, on the genitals, in the lunge or in charge are forbidden. *
 - Prohibit real weapons, sharp tools, sharp, not in perfect condition or considered dangerous by the Magister. *
 - At any time each player must be free to declare himself "out of the game!" And, keeping his hands up, leave the playing field as quickly as possible. The character leaves the scene with the exit of the player's scene. *";
