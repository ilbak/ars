A.R.S. (All-Purpose Roleplaying System) www.ars-rpg.com

ARS is a gaming system aimed at simplicity and adaptability in every play experience.

Born in 2005 from an idea of the BaK (www.ilbak.it) that every year takes care of the edition and the development of new manuals.

The ARS provides a balanced and accessible basis for every kind of game you want to create: role-playing games, tactics, narratives, party games and live games.
