<h1>A.R.S.</h1><h2>(All-Purpose Roleplaying System)</h2>
</h2><a href='https://www.ars-rpg.com'>www.ars-rpg.com</a></h2>

<p>ARS is a gaming system aimed at simplicity and adaptability in every play experience.</p>

<p>Born in 2005 from an idea of Roberto "the BaK" Cananzi (www.ilbak.it) that every year takes care of the edition and the development of new manuals.</p>

<p>The ARS provides a balanced and accessible basis for every kind of game you want to create: role-playing games, tactics, narratives, party games and live games.</p>

<p>The system is based on the concept that every character in a story can be defined by a set of three fundamental values called <b>Attitudes</b>:</p>

  <div class="pagebox">
  <h3><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/sfUTZJE.png">CORPUS</h3>
  Physical strength, endurance and melee attack</td>

  <h3><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/7hpixK6.png">CELERITAS</h3>
  Speed, precision, instrument use and distance attack</td>

  <h3><img src = "https://i.imgur.com/vkP4lCL.png">ANIMUS</h3>
  Knowledge, communication, perception and magical arts</td>
  </div>
  <div class="interblank" style="height:100px;"></div>


<p>Dividing an initial value between these three Attitudes the character is already dashed and balanced within the story.</p>
<p>Each character is also made autonomous by a possible figure of <i> game referee </i>, having already defined values ​​with which to compare for each kind of action.</p>

<p>To facilitate the customization and development of the games from version 15.05 the manuals are distributed in three compatible lines between them: </p>

<p>The narrative line. Only Arts for a narrative game and the younger audience. </p>

<p>ARS was born in a vast panorama of systems in which, however, a true "open language" was lacking, so adaptable as to give life to very different game situations.</p>
<p>The basic manuals are simple flyers of a page, easy to read even online or ready to be printed and easily brought with you. </p>

<p>ARS has been used in several contexts:</p>

<p>In the <b> playful environment </b> over the years has proposed completely original settings and supported by various Italian and foreign gaming groups.</p>
<p> In <b> artistic environment </b> is the first role-playing game to be presented within artistic contexts untied from purely lids, proposing itself as an ideal conjunction between theater and narrative. His continuous development has come to bring the game to its state of the art with presentations of the manuals in festivals and literary circuits.</p>
<p> In <b> social environment </b> is at the center of studies and experiments in the field of education and social assistance: he entered the schools and in situations of social difficulty in which he brought his message of the importance of grouping and that no challenge is really impossible, through the metaphor of Attitudes and Arts.</p>

<p>The ARS has created over the years a very complex reality. Starting from an intense live role playing activity, creating a new <i> format </i> of entertainment, up to the birth of an artistic collective that has supported and followed the production of every kind of material derived from the gaming system.</p>

<p>The game system is distributed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0" target="_blank"> Creative Commons 4.0 license </a> therefore freely downloadable and usable together with basic material that allows examples of easy access to anyone who wants to approach this reality.</p>

<p>The game events related to ARS are varied, from table games to big live role-playing events.</p>
<p>An important occasion for <i> arsini </i> is the "<b>Workaround</b>": a cross-media event that allows all fans to propose their ideas for the development of the system, with a continuous dialogue that allows each year to have <i> "the best possible ARS" </i>.</p>
