The classic line. Attitudes and different arts for the most complete game.


The  *live role-playing game* is a great theatrical improvisation in which all the players are actors. With  *ARS Moka Live* there is no definite narration or setting: on an initial scene, prepared by a "Magister" (who organizes the event and certifies its safety), your character is free to interact as he believes with the other characters and the story that is shared.  *Everything you see and hear is real and useful for the purposes of the game. There are no mimate or described actions and the action takes place in real time.  *There is no material needed to play except this manual that every player must read carefully. The aim of the game is to have fun and better interpret your character by living a real adventure together.



## 1.0 Security

Safety rules to  *be respected absolutely* during the game:
 **Any kind of physical contact is forbidden.**
 **Head and genital attacks are prohibited in combat. Lash attacks (rushing) and in charge (throwing with the weight of the body against the opponent) are forbidden.**
 **Prohibited real weapons or instruments deemed dangerous by the Magister. The equipment not in perfect condition must be delivered to the Magister and must NOT be used.**
 **At any time each player must be free to declare himself "out of the game!" And, keeping his hands up, leave the playing field as quickly as possible. The character "dies" with the player leaving the scene.**
 
## 2.0 The game
The game begins by imagining our character. Keep in mind that we will have to interpret it for a long time and that it will have to be in line with the setting established for the event.
A quick way to define it is to write the "background" a letter in the first person where it is presented with at least three sentences: the first regarding its origin, the second regarding what it currently does and the last concerning what it wants to obtain.
The character is defined by his background and by the Arts, skills in which he is particularly skilled and which we will elaborate further on. The initial equipment for each character will be 1 weapon, 1 protection, 1 instrument + 1 object of choice for each Arte acquired. Usually the backgrounds are delivered before the event to the Magister so that it can verify and integrate them in the history but it is not rare that it is the same Magister to write the background and to assign them, to have a more coherent story or to meet the players. The Magister will give each player a "character sheet" with all the information and which will be referenced in case of controls from the organization.

**[EXAMPLE]** Example: Francesca writes the background of her character: "My name is Lois Searie and I come from a modest London family. I'm a secretary in a real estate company. My innate curiosity leads me to seek new adventures and mysteries to unveil.

The game event begins with the Magister declaring the "Time in!" And ends with the Magister declaring the "Time out!". Between the beginning and the end there are no breaks in the interpretation and in any case the players will have to make sure that the game goes on. Keeping in mind the background you are free to move and interact freely, without any action mimed or described: everything is real.

**[NOTE]** In longer events the characters can be improved by accumulating "Experience Points" that allow the acquisition of some particular skills called Arts. Participating in a live event (with clothes and accessories in theme with the setting of the game) means earning automatically 1 experience point at the beginning of the event. The Magister may assign additional experience points at his discretion, for example to reward those who can complete the objectives in play. Bearing in mind a unique value of Total Experience Points, the number of Experience Points needed to obtain new Arts is progressive by one unit: The first Art is obtained with the first Experience Point, the second one arriving at 3 Total Experience Points (1 + 2), the third one by accumulating 6 (3 + 3), the fourth 10 (6 + 4) and so on.



## 2.1 Game conventions
In addition to free interpretation there are a few extraordinary elements to consider during the game experience:
 **The "ARS" call** : To indicate a particular event in play (such as the effect of a spell or an elaborate object) we use the "ARS" call: a pre-established word to be loudly and loudly exclaimed . This call follows a simple command, a duration and a range: the player to whom this command is addressed must execute it immediately.

**[EXAMPLE]** Lina is playing when an opponent tells her "ARS! Within 5 meters! On the ground for 30 seconds!". Recognizing the call "ARS" Lina is forced to sit on the ground for the 30 seconds indicated.

 **"Hit Points"**: To indicate the health of the character we keep in mind that every limb of our body has 1 point of injury and the area of ​​the trunk (which also includes the head) has 2. Every time a zone suffers a damage it loses hit points: Melee weapons deal 1 hit point, ranged weapons deal 2 points. If a weapon deals a different damage, the player who uses it is required to declare the number of damage dealt to each attack. The area that remains at zero hit points "dies" becoming unusable.
 
 **Work in progress tape**: The white and red ribbon used to indicate a zone of work in progress is the limit between an area in play and an area out of play. This type of ribbon around an object indicates that that object is not in play and therefore must be ignored by players as if it did not exist. A person's neck tape indicates that that person is not currently in play and other players must ignore their presence. Usually this solution is used by the Magister to be able to move freely within the game scene without affecting it.
 
 **The master card**: It is a card made recognizable by the symbol of the game printed in evidence. Indicates a clue or a special game element. On the cover are reported any conditions to be met in order to read the contents of the sign. The signs are written in a clear way, so as to be understandable to anyone. If there are no different instructions, once the card has been read it must be torn and kept out of the game.

**[EXAMPLE]** A lock can carry the sign "Lock that requires 40 seconds of shouting to be cracked" and having completed when indicated the sign can be opened and read.

 **Theft and information**:Inside the game it is also possible to lie and steal. Keep in mind that there is no extra-game information: when players play back information about the game they are automatically considered in play and the information acquired can be used by their characters. All objects may be stolen in play (exceptions are game items and personal belongings of players). As soon as possible the thief must deliver the stolen goods to the Magister so that it can be traced back to the rightful owner once out of the game.
 
 **Recovery**:at the beginning of every hour each character recovers: Half of his total hit points to be added to the zones chosen by the player. Items stolen in the previous game time. Half of the total number of points-Mana and / or master cards he has available.



## 3.0 Advanced Game: Magic
The characters who have the "Magic" Art get a reserve of "Mana" that allows you to use the call "ARS!" In play at will. Each call must use at least one Mana point and more Mana can be sacrificed to concentrate its effects. The call must be made in a clear and aloud, addressing the objective to which it is addressed and consists of three parts, in this way:

### "ARS! [Effect] [Duration] [Distance]"

 *"Effect"* means a simple order (which can not be decomposed into sub-actions) that the target must perform. Each spell can have only ONE effect.
 *"Duration"* indicates the duration in seconds that the spell must have. Each spell has a duration of 10 seconds and for each point. Mana that is added may increase by 10 seconds.
 *"Distance"* is the distance within which the spell takes effect. Each spell has a minimum distance of 5 meters and for each point-Mana that is added can increase by 5 meters.

**[EXAMPLE]** Francesca plays Lois, a clever detective with a passion for occultism. Pursued by a fool Lois decides to cover the escape with a magic help, turning to the opposing character the intimate "ARS! Close your eyes for 10 seconds in 5 meters! " He subtracts a point-Mana from his five total. To be further sure not to be followed evokes a second spell "ARS! Stand still for 20 seconds in 5 meters! "Sacrifices two more points-Mana and can resume the escape.

The call can also have the effect "Damage!" Or "Cure!" In this case the target will choose the part of the body in which to remove or add hit points. Magic cures or damage deal basic 3 hit points and for each point-Mana that you add will increase by 1 hit point. In any case, the number of points dealt or cared for is always to be declared. If the magician suffers at least 1 hit point of damage during the call the spell is canceled and must be rephrased.


## 3.1 Advanced Game: Master Cards
The characters that have the Art "Master Signs" get "Master Signs" that can be placed on the pitch just like those that use the Magister to prepare the scene. They are cards bound to an object or a point of the playing field of your choice that outside they have a condition to be read and inside a description, an effect and a duration that will impose on those who read them. The reading of the card must take place in a conscious action of the reader and it is possible to sacrifice the white signs to concentrate their effects.
The content of a master card will be:

### "[Description] [Effect] for [Duration]"

 *"Description"* is optional but useful to help the reader interpret the sign by specifying, for example, that the sign represents a trap or that it gives him a feeling of relief.
 *"Effect"* means a simple order (which can not be decomposed into sub-actions) that the reader must perform. Each sign can contain only ONE effect.
 *"Duration"* indicates the duration in seconds of the effect. Each sign can contain a 20 second base rate and you can add another 20 seconds for each extra sign that you want to sacrifice. The reader will have to tear the sign once read, so it will only take effect once during the game. Each master card deals or heals 5 basic hit points that increase by 2 for each extra placard that is sacrificed.

**[EXAMPLE]** Giada plays Venusia, a priestess who decides to create a potion of care to offer to her allies: she will attack on a flask a sign with the condition "Mima di bere" and description: "Potion of cure! +5 hit points."

## 4.0 Arts
