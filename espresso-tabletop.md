The fast line. Only the three Attitudes for quick sessions and board games.

A role-playing game is an improvised theatrical interpretation where each player portrays a character in the story for the simple pleasure of role-playing and writing the best story possible together (concept of de interpretatio). One player (the author of the story's "plot" and the game's referee) takes on the role of the Magister, guiding and narrating the development of the story. To ensure everything isn't just a wild hyperbole, it is customary to use a set of game rules that define parameters and limits for game situations. ARS Espresso is an ultra-light ruleset designed to bring role-playing to the simplicity and speed of a board game. This manual presents basic mechanics ready for play which, depending on the setting, can be expanded as desired.

1. The Character
   
Each player creates their character by distributing 10 Creation Points among the following three Attitudes and noting them on their character sheet, each with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum of 8:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7hpixK6.png" style="margin-top:30px;"> CELERITAS Speed, precision, use of tools, and ranged attacks.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vkP4lCL.png" style="margin-top:30px;"> ANIMUS  Knowledge, communication, perception, and magical arts.

[NOTE] To create more or less advanced characters, the Magister may grant a higher or lower number of Creation Points: 5 for Weak, 10 for Normal, 15 for Experts, and 20 for Heroic characters.

The player then notes:

Total Health Points (the character's health reserve: if it reaches zero, the character dies) as a value of Corpus x 2.

Movement (spaces that can be crossed in one action) as a value of Celeritas.

Range (applicable for weapons or ranged actions) as a value of Celeritas x 2.

Starting Money as a value of Animus x 5.

Mana (total reserve of magical power) as a value of Animus x 3.

[EXAMPLE] Luca creates his character, Rogar, a warrior who lives by his wits and travels the world. On his character sheet, he notes: 5 Corpus, 3 Celeritas, 2 Animus. This translates to 10 health points, 3 movement spaces, 6 range spaces, 25 starting money, and 6 mana.

2. Attitudes
   
When a player wishes to use their character's abilities for an action that could have advantages or disadvantages in the story (fighting, using tools, searching, etc.), they must perform an Attitude test related to the type of action taken by rolling a 10-faced die: if the result is equal to or lower than the value of the Attitude used (including any bonuses from Equipment), the test succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Each character can perform 3 actions in each game turn. The first action has no penalty, the second has a -2 penalty, and the third action has a -3 penalty. In an Attitude test, a result of 1 (called a positive critical) is an automatic success, while 10 is a disastrous failure (negative critical). The number of successes in the test is the difference between the value used in the test (with any bonuses) and the die result. Successes represent the effectiveness of the performed test: in combat tests, the number of hits will be the number of health points dealt to the opponent. In ranged tests (with targets beyond the adjacent spaces), every space beyond the Range value accumulates a -1 penalty to the test. In search tests (based on the Animus Attitude), it is the number of surrounding spaces in which the character reveals clues or secrets. In a competitive action between characters, the character with the most hits wins. In a cooperative action, half of the successes or failures obtained by one character are added to those of the character who initiated the action.

[EXAMPLE] Rogar uses his Animus Attitude (2) to search around him. Luca rolls the die and gets a 1. Since the 1 on the die is lower than the value of 2, the action succeeds with 1 success. He indicates to the Magister the space where he will reveal clues, secrets, or traps.

3. Equipment
   
Weapons and tools in the game add a bonus to the Attitude they are associated with (only for actions related to their use). Protections increase the armor value: extra health points consumed before the character's base health points are depleted. Spells transform mana into effects, as indicated in their description. Each character can carry a maximum number of equipment items equal to their current Health Points. The value of equipment is generally attributed at 10 money each: +1 bonus / point of damage dealt or healed / turn of magical effect granted / 1 extra meter of effect. If it is single-use, the value is halved. Equipment grants a maximum total bonus equal to the base value of the involved Attitude. Each item requires an action to be equipped, removed, or moved.

[EXAMPLE] Rogar is in a combat phase and uses his 3 actions in the first round to attack: he will perform his first melee attack test with a value of 7 (Corpus 5 + 2 bonus from a sword), the second action with a value of 5, and the third with a value of 4.
